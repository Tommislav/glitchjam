One of my first attempts to build a game in c++.

Using OpenFrameworks. This project should be placed inside the OF folder structure:
[OF ROOT]/apps/myApps/glitchjam/

Also uses Artemis entity framework (cpp-port), but all source files has just been pasted into this project. Probably not most optimal approach =)

Have got this working both in Visual Studio 2010 express on Windows, and with code::blocks on Linux.
